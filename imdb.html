             <p>This is the project from my class to predict whether a review from IMDb is positive or negative using ML logistic regression, 
                and select the best algorithm based on AUC among Ridge, Lasso and Elastic-net.</p>
             <div>
                <h3><b>Dataset summary</b></h3>
                <p>The dataset of 25,000 movies reviews from IMDB, labeled by sentiment (positive/negative). Reviews have been preprocessed, 
                  and each review is encoded as a sequence of word indexes (integers). For convenience, words are indexed by overall frequency in 
                  the dataset, so that for instance the integer "3" encodes the 3rd most frequent word in the data. This allows for quick filtering 
                  operations such as: "only consider the top 10,000 most common words, but eliminate the top 10 most common words". In this project
                  we set number of words to 2500, which means the model has 2500 features.</p>
                <p>For example, below is a positive review from dataset (the top 10 most common words are replaced by question mark):</p>
                <p><b>? portrays ? day ? day ? reality ? ? on ? ? ? ? old west outstanding acting by both ? actors ? doesn't even feel like ? 
                   movie you feel like you're there animal ? should ? many scenes are obviously not just realistic they are real.</b></p>
                <h3><b>How it works</b></h3>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning algorithm which is used for the classification problems, it is a predictive analysis algorithm and based on the concept of probability.
                    We can call a Logistic Regression a Linear Regression model, but the Logistic Regression uses a more complex cost function.
                  </p>
                    <a class="pull-right" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-logistic-regression-66248243c148">Introduction to Logistic Regression</a>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Three different algorithms in this project have different cost functions. I will use histogram plot that created by Ridge 
                   algorithm to illustrate how logistic regression works to do classification job.</p>
                <div class="article-img" >
                  <img src="./Projects/imdb/hist.jpg" class="center" alt="" width="800" height="200">
                  <figcaption>Stacked Histogram Plot</figcaption>
                </div>
                <h2> </h2>
                <p>The output of the Logistic Regression is between 0 and 1. But as the plot shown above, the values in X axis are not in that 
                  range, because Logistic Regression will do one more step which is exponential transformation to transform the value into range 
                  0,1. (Detail formula). The histogram plot divides review into three groups in different colors and is divided by 0. Say the 
                  threshold of Logistic Regression is 0.5, but it’s not always is 0.5, it depends on if the dataset is balance or not. If the 
                  value of a review is larger than 0, after exponential transformation, the Logistic Regression output will larger than 0.5, we 
                  classify this review as positive, on the contrary, if the value of a review is less than 0, the Logistic Regression output will 
                  less than 0.5, we classify this review as negative. The histogram around value 0, which also means Logistic Regression output is 
                  near 0.5, indicates those review is hard for computer to classify.</p>
                <h3><b>Model Selection</b></h3>
                <p>We use 10-fold cross-validation to tune the best parameter of each model and select one model with the best performance based 
                   on AUC value.</p>
                <div class="col-xs-12" >
                    <img src="./Projects/imdb/Rocs.png" class="article-img" alt="" width="800" height="200">
                    <figcaption>ROC Curves Plot</figcaption>
                </div>
                
                <p>From the ROC curve plots, those three models’ performances are pretty good on predicting test dataset and it’s hard to identify 
                  which one is the best model only according to AUC values. We will discuss more criterions when selecting a suitable model for a 
                  project in <a href="./twbank.html"> Taiwan Bankruptcy</a>, for example, time consuming, random samppling error.</p>
                <h3><b>Top 5 words of reviews</b></h3>
                <p>Even thought performances are similar, the importance of words for each model to classify sentiments are slightly different.</p>
                <h4>Ridge</h4>
                <p><b>From positive reviews:</b></p>
                <p>gem noir captures wonderfully refreshing</p>
                <p><b>From negative reviews:</b></p>
                <p>worst unfunny disappointment lousy waste</p>
                <h4>Lasso</h4>
                <p><b>From positive reviews:</b></p>
                <p>7 refreshing wonderfully captures noir</p>
                <p><b>From negative reviews:</b></p>
                <p>worst waste poorly badly lousy</p>
                <h4>Elastic-net</h4>
                <p><b>From positive reviews:</b></p>
                <p>prince refreshing captures wonderfully noir</p>
                <p><b>From negative reviews:</b></p>
                <p>poorly lousy worst disappointment badly</p>
                <h3><b>Summary</b></h3>
                <p>As for now, we can not decide which algorithm performs better than the other two only considering ROC curve, their AUC values all 
                   look very good in training and testing datasets. However, when you consider model complexicy and time consuming of running code,
                   Ridge regression usually takes less time but more complexicy, Lasso regression takes longer and less model complexicy, Elastic-net
                   regression are between these two. In the <a href="./twbank.html" title="Tai wan bankruptcy">Taiwan Bankruptcy project</a>, we will
                   go deep into complexicy trade-off and discuss in what kind of situation, time matters more than model complexity or the opposite. 
                   But we can know that Logistic Regression model is very suitable here to predict sentiment of movie reviews of IMDb
                   The top 5 words show the importances of features, when model predicts a review, those words will have more contribution to 
                   classify positive or negative.</p>
